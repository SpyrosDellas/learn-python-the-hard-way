I read part of the source code for the keras/engine in Github,
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/engine/training.py,
and noted the following things, some of them to research and learn:

1. Importing from __future__

2. Usage of PEP-8 style guide

3. Frequent usage of exception handling statements: try, except

4. Importing using one dot and two dots as reference to the package

5. Usage of doc strings after function definitions

6. Raising custom exceptions using: raise Exception('')

7. Extended usage of + symbol to concatenate strings

8. Type checking of arguments passed to a function using:
    if type(arg) is type:

9. Using .append() method to adding data to a list

10. Usage of dict type

11. Directly slicing the result of str(), using str()[:]

12. Usage of built-in function hasattr()

13. Usage of built-in function range() in loops

14. Usage of 'continue' keyword

15. Usage of built-in function zip()

16. Usage of built-in function enumerate()
