BUILT-IN CONSTANTS:
True
False
None


BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS:
repr()
str()
raw_input()
input() Note: To be avoided due to security issues
open(name [, mode [, buffering]])  (Returns a file object, most common modes
        are 'r', 'w', 'a', when in 'w' mode file contents are truncated)
file() (Constructor type for the file object, not to be used directly,
        use open() instead)
len()


BUILT-IN TYPES:
File object (supports following methods among others)
      .read()  Returns a string object
      .close()
      .truncate()   Erases file contents
      .write()   Writes a string to the file
      .seek()   Sets the file's current position
      .readline()   Read current line and moves current position to next line


BUILT-IN MODULES AND SUBMODULES:
sys, sys.argv
os, os.path, os.path.exists


SYMBOLS, OPERATORS AND DELIMITERS:
" " (double quotes)
""" (triple double quotes)
' ' (single quotes)
''' (triple single quotes)
# (hash)
+ (plus)
- (dash, minus)
_ (underscore)
/ (backslash)
* (asterisk)
= (equals)
== (equals equals)

% (percent, modulus)
> (greater)
< (less)
>= (greater than or equal)
<= (less than or equal)
!= (not equal)
+=
-=

ENCODING DECLARATION:
# -*- coding: <encoding-name> -*- (must be the first or second line in the
script, if second then first line must be a comment)


NUMERIC LITERALS:
integer (can be decimal, binary, octal or hexadecimal, largest
        integer representable is approx 2e9 when using 32-bit arithmetic)
long integer, i.e. an integer with suffix ("L" | "l") is a long integer,
              for example 53325L is a long integer
floating point (includes exponents, for example 1e-10)
imaginary  (an integer or floating point number with suffix ("J" | "j"),
            for example 2.345j)


FORMULAS FACTS:
PEMDAS Standard is used in formulas evaluation


STRING LITERALS:
Prefixes:
    r or R (raw strings)
    u or U (denotes UNICODE string)

Escape sequences:
    \\
    \'
    \"
    \n (ASCII line feed, equivalent to ENTER)
    \t (ASCII horizontal TAB)
    \a (ASCII bell)
    \v (ASCII vertical TAB)
    \f (ASCII form feed, equivalent to PAGE BREAK)
    \r (ASCII carriage return, return to beginning of current line)
    \uxxxx (16 bit Unicode, must be used with u or U prefix)
    \Uxxxxxxxx (32 bit Unicode, must be used with u or U prefix)
    \ooo (character with octal value ooo)
    \xhh (character with hexadecimal value hh)

Formatters:
    %s (Calls str() built-in function)
    %r (Calls repr() buit-in function which returns a printable
       representation of an object)
    %d (Decimal Integer)
    {} (Place holder for .format() function)
    {:.2f} (Denotes number with to decimal digits)
    {!r} (Equivalent to %r)
    .format()  (Formating function for strings)


STRING FACTS:
1. Strings are immutable, i.e. we can't change a part of a string
2. String can be indexed and sliced, for example str[x] or str[[x]:[y]]
